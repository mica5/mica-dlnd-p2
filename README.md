This is a project from Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) program.

This is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network jupyter notebook for classifying images on the CIFAR-10 dataset as part of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundations Program

For inspiration, I reviewed the architecture of [AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks).
